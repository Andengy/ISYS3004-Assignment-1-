        <h2>Structure: HTML </h2>
        <p> A navigation bar that includes links to different sections of the website: 
            Home, About Me, My Projects, and Contact. An “About Me” section with a brief biography. 
            A “My Projects” section showcasing at least three projects you have worked on or conceptualised. 
        </p>
        <p>Include images, descriptions, and links if available. 
            A “Contact” section with a form to submit a message to you (functionality not required). 
            Footer with social media links (real or fictional).
        </p> 
  
        <h2 id="Stlye">Style: CSS</h2>
        <p>Style (CSS): Ensure your website is responsive and looks good on mobile, tablet, and desktop views. 
            Implement a consistent color scheme and typography throughout your site. 
            Add hover effects to navigation links and buttons for interactivity.
        </p>


        <h2 id= "Interactivity"> Interactivity: Javascript </h2>
        <p> Implement a “dark mode” toggle that changes the theme of your website. Create a dynamic gallery in the “My Projects” section, 
            where clicking on a project image opens a modal with more details about the project. 
            Include form validation in the “Contact” section, ensuring all fields are filled out before submission.
